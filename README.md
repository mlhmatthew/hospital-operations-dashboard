# hospital-operations-dashboard
Role-based Power BI dashboard for hospital operations built on synthetic data — includes Medical, Pharmacy, Financial, and Administrative views.

This project showcases a Power BI dashboard designed to simulate real-time analytics for hospital management. Built from synthetically generated data, the dashboard offers role-specific views across medical, pharmacy, financial, and administrative domains — helping users monitor key performance indicators and improve operational decisions.

## 🎯 Objective
